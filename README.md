# 🧠 Customer Insurance Purchase Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will purchase health insurance based on their **Age** and **Estimated Salary** using multiple **Machine Learning algorithms**.  
A comparative study is performed to identify the most accurate model while balancing generalization and avoiding overfitting.

---

## 📌 Business Objective
As an analyst in a Bank Insurance Company, the task is to build a predictive model that can classify potential customers as likely to purchase insurance or not.  
This helps the company make **data-driven decisions** for targeted marketing and customer acquisition.

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned dataset, feature scaling, train-test split.  

2. **Algorithms Implemented**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - Decision Trees  
   - Random Forest  

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  

4. **Comparative Analysis**  
   - Metrics tabulated for each model  
   - KNN selected as **best performing model**  

---

## 📊 Results & Insights
- **Best Model:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- **Key Findings:**  
  - Salary has a stronger influence on insurance purchases than age.  
  - Younger individuals with higher salaries are more likely to purchase.  
- **Example Predictions:**  
  - Age 30, Salary 87,000 → ✅ Will Purchase  
  - Age 40, Salary 100,000 → ❌ Will Not Purchase  

---

## 📈 Graphical Analysis
The notebook includes visualizations:
- Age vs Purchase decision  
- Salary vs Purchase decision  
- Decision boundary plots for classifiers  

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned & Applications
- Comparative ML analysis helps identify the most suitable algorithm for a given dataset.  
- Real-world Applications:  
  1. **Insurance:** Customer targeting & personalized policy offers.  
  2. **Finance:** Credit risk prediction & loan repayment likelihood.  

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Add **Neural Networks (MLP)** for deeper learning.  
- Expand dataset with more features (gender, occupation, region).  
- Deploy as a **Flask/Django web app** or a **Streamlit dashboard**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
